# Forest Covertype Classification with CatBoost

This repository contains the code and analysis for solving the Forest Covertype classification problem using the CatBoost algorithm.

## Problem Statement

The Forest Covertype dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning, containing information about the type of forest cover based on various geographical and environmental factors. The task is to build a model that can accurately predict the forest cover type given these features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Forest Covertype dataset, which includes both numerical and categorical features related to the geographical and environmental attributes of the forests. The target variable is the forest cover type, which has multiple classes.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

To prepare the dataset for modeling, the following steps were performed:

- Handling missing values: Checked for missing values and decided on an appropriate strategy, such as imputation or removal, based on the percentage of missing values and the nature of the data.

- Feature selection: Identified and selected relevant features based on domain knowledge and feature importance analysis.

- Feature engineering: Generated new features or transformed existing features to capture additional information that could improve model performance.

- Data normalization: Scaled numerical features using Min-Max scaling to ensure all features have a similar range.

## CatBoost Algorithm

CatBoost is a powerful gradient boosting algorithm that can handle categorical features efficiently without requiring extensive pre-processing. It is known for its ability to handle high-cardinality categorical features, automatically handling feature transformations, and providing good generalization performance.

In this project, the CatBoost algorithm was used for training the classification model on the Forest Covertype dataset. The algorithm was chosen due to its ability to handle categorical features and its strong performance in various machine learning tasks.
